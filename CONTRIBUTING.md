# Why Contribute?
What economic system enables a Kardashev Type 1 civilization? Do you really think it's what we've got now?

What happens when AI and robots swallow jobs wholesale? Print money for UBI and hope you don't need a wheelbarrow full of cash to buy a loaf of bread next year?

What if we can turn job replacement into an economic system's strength, even its primary growth factor, rather than a death sentence?

Does anyone saying "The future is abundance" with starry-eyed fever pitch have any clue what that actually means, or is it baseless hype?

**Project-Asimov isn't selling dreams: it's old-fashioned hard work today applied to the problems of tomorrow.**

Maybe Robonomics is a terrible idea. Then again, maybe it's Kardashev 1+ economics. Project Asimov is the place for people who want to make tangible progress toward making that call.

If you so choose, this is where your contribution begins.

If you're thinking of contributing or if you already are contributing and need a refresher, this is where you can get the nitty-gritty details on the Asimov system architecture.

## Let's Get Housekeeping Out of the Way
As the official design document, this is the One Source of Truth. If it's not here, it's not yet Project-Asimov canon. If you think something in this document contradicts itself, please raise a docs issue on our [Issues Board](https://github.com/GrokkingGrok/Project-Asimov/issues) before you do anything else and forget. When writing new documentation or code, check here first so you understand how your feature fits into the grand scheme of things. 

Before you can merge any feature or fix to main, it will need to be fully documented, too. If that documentation means this or anything else needs to change, submit an issue for tracking.

What I'm getting at is this document needs to be up to date and correct, or bad things happen.

I'm Jon, by the way, the current Owner and Manager of Project Asimov, until someone smarter and better comes along, at least.

## Quick Point of Clarification
"Asimov" refers to the Python Package. "Project-Asimov" is the open source effort to create "Asimov". `Robonomics.py` is the Python class that contains an entire Robonomic/RoboTorq Economy. We'll be doing lots of defining in this document.

## The Basics
Project-Asimov runs on Python 3.13. 
  * Not the fastest, but dependable and readable. And about the speed...
  * Various Python 3.13 ops speed up 10x-100x using `Polars DataFrames`, which we do. Not familiar with Polars?
    * The awesome [YouTuber Mariya Sha of Python Simplified has a great Polars intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GoBlwgbirE)

## Overview
Simulating any economy in a pseudo-realistic fashion requires modeling a massive, nearly infinitely tangled web of interactions... Oof, sounds complicated. Maybe it will get better?

Naturally, we'll need to name *all* the parts of this simulated economy to discuss it in any meaningful way, much more so to code it!

The `economy` is a complex data structure known as a `graph`, `actors` are `nodes` in the `graph`, and *flow* are `edges` that... OK, well, that was even worse. Let's try this another way.

## Robonomics Lingo Really Does Help Simplify Things

...once you understand a few basic terms. Thankfully, you have this guide. It helps if you think of this like a video game world. `actors` are the characters, and *flows* are the things they can do.

**Two Steps Back**
In excruciatingly necessary terms: Each *flow* is designed to move a single type of thing, for one particular reason, between two unique `actors`, in only one direction, at a fixed rate, according to each `actor's` attribute schema, for an prescribed duration, at which point, it is *always responsible for flagging itself for removal from the `economy`*.

The naming conventions are designed to distance conversation from the underlying data structures through abstraction, allowing anyone to discuss the simulation without understanding computer science jargon. Let's use the three terms we've already defined in an example.
  * Example: Every `Bondholder` is connected to `Isaac` via a persistent *DistoStream* *flow*.

There is a *lot* of information encoded in that sentence.

Let's unpack what that means in more exact terms, so you can see how the abstraction focuses on WHAT the data represents, rather than HOW the underlying data structure gets the job done.
  * A `Bondholder` owns at least one `Bond` signifying shared ownership of a humanoid `Robot`.
  * `Isaac` is the `node` that mints and distributes `RoboTorq` to `Bondholder` `nodes`, which happens via a `edge` that connects each `node`.
  * A *DistoStream* is the specific type of graph `edge` connecting the two `nodes`, we call any `edge` a *flow* (*flows* italicized in this doc so you can tell the difference)
  * It is "persistent" because this particular *flow* will last longer than one cycle of the simulation.
  * Asimov's simulation cycle timer proceeds using two different mechanisms, ticks and steps, more on those later.

Once again: Each *flow* is designed to move a single type of thing, for one particular reason, between two unique `actors`, in only one direction, at a fixed rate, according to each `actor's` attribute schema, for an prescribed duration, at which point, it is *always responsible for flagging itself for removal from the `economy`*.

Once you really internalize this key mechanism of moving data through the economy, the rest is easy.

## The Perfect *Flow* Analogy?
Imagine you have a blow gun that shoots one dart at a time. In this example, each dart would be a *flow* moving from one `actor`, you, the source, to another `actor`, the target.

You have three kinds of darts. 
  * One is a normal dart. You shoot it, it either hits its target or misses.
  * Another has a string attached to it.
    * If you hit your target, you can pull the string tight and transfer messages along it like with two cups and a string as long as its stuck in the target.
    * This is a persistent *flow*.
  * The final kind of dart is very special.
    * If this dart hits its target, it can shoot more darts and hit other targets automatically.
    * And some of those are special darts as well, they shoot their own darts if they hit their targets.
    * But you, the `actor` who shot it, are responsible for making sure you hit the initial target.
    * And if you're expecting something in return, and don't get it, you're also responsible for shooting another dart.
  * We, the programmers, are responsible for making sure misses don't happen, and that if they do, the program doesn't crash.
   
Keep this in mind as you read through the following sections, and the RoboTorq economy will take shape in your mind soon enough.

## Other Key Terms & Data Structures

From here, we can start defining key terms more readily.
  * `Registries` like `BondholderRegistry` (a Polar DataFrame for storing attributes of every node) and `EnterpriseRegistry` (for enterprises).
  * `Models` map `Registries` to the `Economy`'s graph structure. Every data structure inside the simulation can interact with each other through this class: `src/asimov/models/robonomics.py`
  * `Oracles` track the activity of `Robots` as they produce.
  * `RoboTorq` is the currency itself, backed by the realized productive output of the Bond Network's fleet as a whole.
  * `Torq` is a metric used to help in internal `Oracle` and `Production` auditing/tracking, as well as the valuation of production.
  * `TokenTorq` is almost like an internal exchange rate, used to quantify the AI requirements of robotic production within the `Torq` measurement process, assisting with the valuation of RoboTorq.

## Systemic Actors and Their Interactions in Detail (Ideal Simulation Behavior)
A hypothetical "real" RoboTorq Economy would have several AI actors managing the various subsystems, allowing the `Bondholders` and `Enterprises` to interact with each other smoothly. In this section, all `boxes that look like this` denote `nodes` (i.e. `actors` only).

This section will go into extreme detail. You should be able to reference this document and understand the place of your work within the grand scheme of the RoboTorq Economy.
  
  **How RoboTorq Gets into the Economy**
  * `Isaac` is the RoboTorq Economy's AI mint and distribution hub.
  * `Bondholders` receive a constant trickle of RoboTorq from `Isaac`, 24/7/365.
  * This constant trickle is called a *DistoStream* *flow* (specific instances of *flows*, like *DistoStream*, will also be italicized to separate the two ideas)
  
  **How RoboTorq moves through the Economy: Spending & Investing**
  * `Enterprises` sell goods and services to `Bondholders` with a *SellsToBondholder* *flow*.
  * `Bondholders` invest in `Enterprises` at `RoboFund` in lieu of the stock market.
  * `RoboFund` is how `Bondholders` invest in individual `Projects` that `Enterprises` need funding for.
  * `Bondholders` choose which `BuyerFunnels` and `MakerFunnels` to invest in, which are tied to `Projects`.

  **Consumer Savings in `TorqVaults` (if you were expecting a bank, you haven't been paying attention)**
  * `Bondholders` can divert *DistoStreams* to `TorqVaults` using flows such as *StashVaultPledge* or *TorqedPledges* to avoid having their wallet's idle hoard swept up by Isaac during demurrage.
  * `TorqVaults` operate on AI math, not banker vibes.
    * Not all `TorqVaults` are created equal.
    * They offer various ways for `Enterprises` and `Bondholders` to both finance purchases and save.
    * A `Bondholder` can choose how much of a stash to stake for loans.
    * Staked RoboTorq can't be accessed at will.
    * Stakings can earn more, but can also be lost if the loan isn't repaid.
  * If a `Bondholder` wants the safest savings, they'll send it to a `StashVault` using a *StashVaultPledge*.
    * Stash vaults have low returns, but fast access to savings.
    * Demurraged RoboTorq from `Bondholders` not managing their *flows* properly goes to `StashVaults` equally.
    * `Bondholders` saving for a new furniture set might use a `StashVault`.
  * If a `Bondholder` is saving for a big purchase, like building a house, they'll send it to a `TorqedVault` using a *TorqedPledges*.
    * `TorqedVaults` are where you save for a down payment on a purchase you know you're going to make.
    * It's an automatic pledge to divert future portions of a *DistoStream* to the `TorqedVault`.
    * Lump sums can be deposited at any time.
    * Withdrawals are not as fast or easy as `StashVaults`, and are impossible once the planned purchase has been made.
    * When the minimum needed collateral for your purchase, combining current and future pledges, is attained, work starts on your house.
  * This is a completely different way of financing things like houses.
    * Instead of creating money for the loan to pay the developer up front to build the house, the system is looking at what's already planned to be minted off realized value in Isaac's `DistoBuffer`, and how much of that is planned to go to the `Bondholder` in question.
    * It's also looking at the BRLA tied to the Developer building houses with robotic labor, to estimate what would likely be scheduled to be minted due to the future work.
    * And it's looking at the already saved collateral.
    * And it's looking at the `Bondholder's` future liabilities already on the blockchain.
    * And their past reputation for meeting pledges.
    * All to determine this `Bondholder's` ability to pay for the house.
    * If the `Bondholder` misses a pledge, no worries, they buy buffer insurance for large purchases like this, and borrow against that pool if they miss a pledge.

  **Investing & Commercial Financing**
  * When a `Project` is funded, it is converted to a `Bid`, to be vetted by `BidNet`.
  * If the `Bid` passes initial vetting, `BidNet` asks `Giskard` and `Daneel` for input about accepting the bid.
  * `Giskard` (pronounced discard with a 'g') provides various inputs to help `BidNet` decide whether to accept or reject `Bids`, as well as tracking TokenTorq and Torq in the economy.
  * `Daneel` also provides input to `BidNet`.
  * If `Giskard` and `Daneel` agree, `BidNet` always follows their advice.
  * If they are not in agreement, `BidNet` weighs both inputs and is the tiebreaker.
  * `Enterprises` pay brla_retainer_fee to secure `BRLA`.

  **How Production Happens**
  * `Giskard` receives the accepted `Bid` as a Bonded Robotic Labor Agreement, or `BRLA`.
  * He attaches all `Oracles` to the `BRLA`.
  * `Giskard` uses a portion of the brla_retainer_fee for the AI cost of processing `BRLA`.
  * He sends the `BRLA` to `Daneel`.
  * `Daneel's` primary job is to balance the utilization of the robotic fleet.
  * This helps to maximize the rate at which the system can purchase new robots by making smart decisions about how to allocate fleet resources.
  * `Daneel` deploys `Robots` to the `JobSite`.
  * The `BRLA` assigns `Oracles` to `Robots` for production to begin.
  * `Robots` notify the `BRLA` when an `Oracle` is fulfilled.
  
  **How RoboTorq is Recycled & Minted**
  * `Daneel` uses brla_retainer_fee to maintain the fleet.
  * `Enterprises` pay per `Oracle` fulfilled.
  * `BRLA` sends *FulfilledOracle* data to `Giskard`.
  * `Giskard` calculates `Torq` associated with `Oracle`.
  * `Giskard` sends a *MintRequest* to `Isaac`.

## From here, the whole cycle starts over again, and it gets bigger

The simulation loop repeats, propagating changes through the model via two method calls, *tick()* and *step()*:
  * Both of these methods call similarly named functions within individual `actors` and *flows*.
    * ticks are *mostly* associated with *flow*.
    * steps are *mostly* associated with `actors`.
  * 1 call to *step()* happens every X number of calls to *tick()*
    * A standard step_diff is 24: meaning 24 ticks to every step.
  * This simulates a daily cycle where ticks happen on the hour, and steps happen daily.

Let's stop and explore what this means for a moment, and see how things fit together now that we've defined how time *flows* in our Robonomics video game.

## Ticks of Time in Asimov

Different things happen in ticks than in steps. In ticks:

In ticks, every *flow* active at the beginning of the cycle will have its tick method called, without exception. In contrast, the vast majority of individual `actors` (Bondholders, Enterprises) do not even have a tick method to call.

AI `actors` that act as prolific generators of *flow*, like `Isaac`, do have a tick method, syncing him with all of the *DistoStreams* emanating from him.

Ticks are tracked in the aptly named field `Robonomics.current_tick`. Fancy. But there's more. We've got `Robonomics.current_step`. And because there is a difference between ticks and steps, we have the most aptly named of all: `Robonomics.step_diff`.
  - Tick Tip: `Robonomics.current_tick` and `current_step` initialize to 0 by default, with `step_diff` set to 24, to kick off the simulation’s daily heartbeat. This sets the stage for 24 ticks per step, keeping the graph pulsing steadily.
  - Change step_diff to see what happens.
  - Future versions will have this encoded in a Parameter File.

## Steps of Time in Asimov

In steps, every node in the model is activated. *In the whole model*.

This means that `actors` who currently have no connection to the RoboTorq Economy now have the opportunity to spawn their own *flow* to other `actors` at will. But only once every step_diff ticks!

`actors` currently connected to the economy have the opportunity to do things like change their spending_habits in reaction to market signals.

Then, during the next series of ticks, each `actor` behaves according to the changes made during the previous step.

At the end of every tick or step, the model prunes any completed *flows* from the economy. `actors` with no active *flows* are no longer connected, and can't proactively attempt to do so until the next step.

*flows* can still find and connect with orphaned `actors` during any tick, but `actors` can't choose to become connected until a step is called on it.

## What does all this mean for Asimov?

It bear repeating once more (in excruciatingly necessary terms): Each *flow* is designed to move a single type of thing, for one particular reason, between two unique `actors`, in only one direction, at a fixed rate, according to each `actor's` attribute schema, for an prescribed duration, at which point, it is *always responsible for flagging itself for removal from the `economy`*.

This keeps the graph lean and fast. Combine that with tick and step timing, and you control the pulse of RoboTorq flow through the economy. 

This brings to mind imagery like one atrium of the heart pulling in blood, and the other pushing it out.

Certain `actors` generate *flow*. Each *flow* starts a chain reaction of new *flows* that branch out across the RoboTorq Economy spontaneously, yet rhythmically, like pulsating blood vessels that expand and contract to the rhythm of every heartbeat, infecting new nooks and crannies of the pre-RoboTorq economy at every pass.

This will be modeled much like a heartbeat in the coming versions: 
  - Each step causes a flurry of edge creations as `actors` light up to perform their various step function behaviors in reaction to the last series of ticks.
  - In between steps, the *flows* spawn *flows* spawn *flows*... but the *flow* creation rate will dwindle over with each passing tick, on average.
  - When *flow* creation hits a parameterized threshold, automatically jumpstart the `actors` with a call to step, like a pacemaker!

And each heartbeat needs compute.

## 10,000 Bondholders is the MVP Goal

Scale this whole process we've discussed up to even a modest 10 `Bondholders`, 1 `Enterprise`, and 1 `Robot`, and you can see how quickly it becomes unmanageably complex for a human to track without careful attention to detail. 

We'll be going much larger.

The ultimate goal of Project-Asimov is 
  * A *bare minimum of hundreds of millions* of `Bondholders`.
  * *Tens of millions* of `Enterprises`,
  * *hundreds of millions* of `Robots`.
  * With the potential for *1-2 billion concurrent *flows**.

This will require a large distributed computing cluster. Realistically, that won't happen until people at universities get involved, perhaps even several universities working together.

And we can't model hundreds of millions until we can model tens of millions, which requires millions, and so on down to just a single `Bondholder`. And that's where I started.

# So Let's Start Small: A Minimally Viable Product (MVP) and Roadmap to v1.0.0

So far, you've seen a lot of big ideas, but they have to start smaller in practice. 

Two rounds of prototyping provided me with v0.2.0, using Mesa-Frames. v0.2.1 ditches Mesa-Frames to rule out unknowns in the scaling process concerning the two backends playing nicely, as well as difficulty holding multiple agent types, though honestly, IBKAC errors may have been the bigger culprit. The world may never know, because the solution I eventually landed on fits the model better.

This process helped me clarify the MVP's Core Requirements. The MVP will be known as v0.3.0. By breaking down the above simulation loop discussion, we can arrive at the following set of MVP Core Requirements and expand that into a Roadmap to v1.0.0 and beyond.

This list is subject to change at any time for any reason, as it gets processed into the Issues Board and MVP Project tracker.

## v0.3.0 MVP Core Requirements (10 bondholders)

  - Each AI Actor is an actual AI.
  - `Isaac` is now a separate machine, with a cluster under him to distribute RoboTorq to.
  - LLM integration to talk to the simulation as it runs.
  - If no universities bite, plan a program like SETI's where people volunteer their personal background compute.

## v4.0.* Initial Super Cluster Release (100-350 million bondholders)
  - `Isaac` is a cluster, and he talks to his cluster of bondholders.
  - This is the current foreseeable limit of the system architecture.

So, how are we going to get there? We'll need some solid strategies as well as a fundamental understanding of good design.

## Development Strategy & Philosophy
Project-Asimov emphasizes the test-driven development (TDD) style, writing tests before coding features to ensure reliability for *flows* and registries, and making code review easier.

**Test-Driven Development Example**
For the *SecureBRLA* flow, we’d first write a test like `test_secure_brla_payment` (new file located at `tests/asimov/flow/credit/test_secure_brla.py`) to check that Conglomocorp’s `robotorq_holdings` updates from 0 to 100,000 RoboTorq after a *SeedXfer* flow, using `pytest` (e.g., `assert registry.df["robotorq_holdings"].sum() == 100000.0`). 

Only then do we code the feature intended to pass this test, ensuring robust BRLA signing.

**Why Test Driven Development**
TDD helps keep feature bloat to a minimum: if you want to write a feature, you have to write a test first to get it into main, so just how bad do you want to add that extra little bling that could maybe break 20 other things, maybe not?

It may sound like a pain at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll see the value when working on a distributed project like this. When someone else is reviewing your pull request, your tests provide context for understanding your code. And that goes the same for when you review their pull request.

Test-driven development can be a cornerstone of good design and execution when done right, but it's not the whole bridge from idea to final product. Here are some other important notes about the overall design philosophy of Project-Asimov.

## Other Design Philosophy Notes
You'll find that *flow*, as a category, contains the bulk of the simulation's logic. But that doesn't mean they're bloated classes, overflowing with code.

Each *flow* is designed to move a single type of thing, for one particular reason, between two unique `actors`, in only one direction, at a fixed rate, according to each `actor's` attribute schema, for an exact duration of ticks or steps, at which point, it is *always responsible for flagging itself for removal from the `economy`*.

When creating and calling *flow* methods, this object is set it and forget it. You can think of *flows* as ephemeral, self-contained function calls that flash into and out of existence as quickly as they complete their job. Pretty cool, huh?

However, there are **many** different types of *flow*, since each *flow* does exactly one thing.

This set of simple, yet exact constraints: 
  - Prioritizes simplicity and modularity, with *flows* handling interactions and spawning new *flows* to ignite the next interaction, and because they're self-dissolving they keep the graph clean and lean
  - Encourages scalability because memory does not bloat with used *flows*.
  - Encourages community input, designing for future features (e.g., Giskard and Daneel). Here's how.

Once the core simulation logic is defined, adding new features largely becomes a matter of designing new *flow* loop logic. 

See this example *flow* loop logic below. Looking at the handling of *SecureBRLA* *flow* in v0.2.1, you'll see that the creation of the *SecureBRLA* *flow* spawns a flurry of activity that loops between three different `actors`.

Ready to go deep? How do you jumpstart a whole RoboTorq economy when no RoboTorq exists? Bit of a catch-22.

**v0.2.1 Flow Loop Logic for Jumpstarting Economy with SecureBRLA**
  - Created during the initial call to Robonomics.run_model(), adding a one-tick *SecureBRLA* request from the `BRLA` to `Conglomocorp`.
    - Initializes with `BRLA` as source and Conglomocorp as target, passing model=robonomics for graph access.
  - When `Conglomocorp` does not have enough RoboTorq (none exists yet), this *SecureBRLA* creates a *SeedNeeded* request to `Isaac` from `Conglomocorp`.
    - Calls self.create_flow("conglomocorp_001", "Isaac", *SeedNeeded* , {}) to spawn *SeedNeeded*. 
    - Logs to src/asimov/output/flow_logs.txt (e.g., “Spawned *SeedNeeded*: conglomocorp_001 → Isaac” on success, “Failed to spawn *SeedNeeded*: [error]” on exception) via a try-except block.
    - Proceeds regardless of success, per your no-waiting rule.
  - This *SecureBRLA* request is marked as completed and flags itself for removal when the *SeedNeeded* is created.
      - After create_flow() returns (successful or not), sets self.is_completed = True
      - and attempts try: self.model.graph.dissolve(self)
      - with logging (“Dissolved *SecureBRLA*: brla_001 → conglomocorp_001” on success, error on fail).
  - *SecureBRLA* will be gone from memory, like it never existed before **any** of the following actions take place the following tick.
  - The *SeedNeeded* request spawns a *SeedXfer* credit *flow* in the amount of 5 x brla_retainer_fee (default=5 x 100,000) from Isaac to Conglomocorp.
  - *SeedNeeded*'s tick() (next cycle) calls self.create_flow("Isaac", "conglomocorp_001", "", {"amount": 500000}), logging success/failure.
  - The *SeedXfer* credit spawns a *RetainerXfer* credit from Conglomocorp to the BRLA.
  - *SeedXfer*’s tick() (next cycle) calls self.create_flow("conglomocorp_001", "brla_001", "*RetainerXfer*", {"amount": 100000}), logging accordingly.
  - The *RetainerXfer* credit pays the brla_retainer_fee to the BRLA.
  - *RetainerXfer*’s tick() (next cycle) updates Conglomocorp’s robotorq_holdings in EnterpriseRegistry and marks payment, logging the action.

This is why I talk about RoboTorq "infecting" the host economy. We'll be using several tools to guide this infection as efficiently as possible.

## Tech Stack
  - **Polars**:
    - **Description**: A fast DataFrame library for in-memory data processing.
    - **Pros**: Blazing speed for large datasets, perfect for bondholder/enterprise registries.
    - **Cons**: Steeper learning curve than Pandas for some operations.
    - **Justification**: Powers efficient DataFrame updates in `BondholderRegistry` for the MVP.
    - **Example Usage**: Querying `robotorq_holdings` with `df.filter(pl.col("bondholder_id") == "conglomocorp_001")`.
  - **GRAPE**:
    - **Description**: A Rust-based graph library for scalable network operations.
    - **Pros**: Handles thousands of nodes/*flows* with speed, ideal for GRAPE graph management.
    - **Cons**: Less mature API than NetworkX, may need workarounds.
    - **Justification**: Enables *flow* dissolution and graph scaling in `Robonomics`.
    - **Example Usage**: Removing a *flow* with `graph.remove_edge("brla_001", "conglomocorp_001")`.
  - **DASK**:
    - **Description**: A parallel computing library for distributed data processing.
    - **Pros**: Scales DataFrame operations across multiple cores or machines.
    - **Cons**: Adds complexity for small datasets like the MVP, will not add until later most likely.
    - **Justification**: Prepares for future Monte Carlo runs with large-scale simulations.
    - **Example Usage**: Running `Isaac` and `Bondholders` on one cluster, running `Robots` and `Daneel` on a second, `BRLAs` and `Giskard` on a third, etc.
  - **RAY (Future)**:
    - **Description**: A framework for distributed computing and reinforcement learning.
    - **Pros**: Enables parallel *flow* processing and AI-driven behaviors (e.g., Giskard).
    - **Cons**: Overhead for MVP’s single-node setup.
    - **Justification**: Planned for v1.0 to scale AI and Monte Carlo experiments.
    - **Example Usage**: Distributing ticks with `ray.remote(flow.tick)`.
## Other Tools under Consideration
  - **QuantEcon**:
    - **Description**: A framework for economic analysis. Should be a good fit.
    - **Pros**: more realistic behavior, fast library, more citable
    - **Cons**: More to learn, maybe overhead.
    - **Justification**: Powerful behavior tools for better modeling/analysis.
    - **Example Usage**: Bondholders have varying degrees of economic intelligence, and change in response to market conditions more realistically.
## UI/UX Design
  - **Requirements**:
    - Display real-time *flow* interactions (e.g., *SecureBRLA* to *SeedXfer*) and registry data (e.g., `robotorq_holdings`) for the MVP.
    - Support TDD with testable UI components (e.g., test *flow* visualizations with `pytest`).
    - Scale to thousands of nodes (bondholders, enterprises) without lag.
    - **Bonus**: Add a cyberpunk flair, dark mode with neon visuals to wow users/viewers.
**Dealbreaker Qualities**
    - Needing to reload if a live-tuning is made, like streamlit
    - Inability to live-tune
**Considering**
    - Gradio: relatively lightweight UI that may have testing applications for prototyping visualizations?
    - Dash: Best contender for final UI at this point.

## Closing Words

This is a living document. Expect it to change often for now. When a change occurs, expect a [Discussion Board Topic](https://github.com/GrokkingGrok/Project-Asimov/discussions) to pop up, letting everyone know.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication to Project-Asimov.
