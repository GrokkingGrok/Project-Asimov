# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of Project-Asimov, pledge to foster a respectful and respectable community. We commit to making participation a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:
- Using polite language.
- Showing a willingness to both learn and teach.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks.
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., email or address) without permission.
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

We practice **test-driven development (TDD)**, a method where we write tests *before* coding new features or flows (e.g., `SecureBRLA`, `SeedXfer`). In simple terms, TDD means 
- imagining how a part of the simulation should work (like a bondholder activating on a BRLA),
- writing a test to check that behavior, and then coding until the test passes.

This ensures our code (built with Polars and GRAPE) is reliable and easy to improve, especially for complex economic interactions. All Contributors are required to follow this by adding tests (e.g., using `pytest`) that pass along with each new pull request for code review.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at [your-email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, with appropriate action taken at the maintainers' discretion.

## Attribution
