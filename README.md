# Project-Asimov: Post-Scarcity Robonomics Simulation

What if robots don't just produce things? What if every time a robot makes something, an AI crypto-mint spins up and you get a tiny bit of that value in your digital wallet as a new cryptocurrency, RoboTorq?

What if you just found the repo simulating such an economy?

## What are we working on now?

In the Minimally Viable Product (v0.2.0 MVP), the remarkably ethical Conglomocorp signs a Bonded Robot Labor Agreement (BRLA), securing a lump sum of RoboTorq from Isaac, the AI mint. The robots get to work making widgets that the bondholders can't resist.

Bondholders receive newly minted RoboTorq "disto" (distribution) streams and spend them on Conglomocorp’s products. Conglomocorp spends that RoboTorq on more robotic labor, which causes more RoboTorq to be minted, and so on.

Building on a Polars backend for fast DataFrames and GRAPE for scalable graphs, flows (edges like `SecureBRLA`, `SeedXfer`) self-dissolve after one tick, keeping the system efficient.

## Why Contribute?

- Explore robotic economics with real-world potential.
- Scalable design with Polars and GRAPE for thousands of nodes and Monte Carlo runs - real academic-grade data engine.
- Shape the project: add flows, enhance AI valuation (e.g., Giskard’s token audits), or design a UI.
- Join an open-source effort to rethink economic systems.

## Roadmap

- **v0.2.0 (MVP)**: Conglomocorp funds BRLA, Robots work, Isaac mints, disto streams flow, bondholders spend, Conglomocorp pays more robots, Isaac mints more money, etc etc etc...
- **Future**: Parameter File Driven initialization, UI, Live Parameter Updates via UI, Multiple System Level Actors, Multiple enterprises, AI-driven Torq valuation, Monte Carlo experiments, distributed execution with 350+ million bondholders, etc.
