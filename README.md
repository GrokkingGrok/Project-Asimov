# Project-Asimov: Post-Scarcity Robonomics Simulation

What if robots don't just produce things? What if everytime a robot makes something, an AI crypto-mint spins up and you get a tiny bit of that value in your digital wallet as a new cyrptocurrency, RoboTorq?

What if you just found the repo simulating such an economy?

## What’s It About?

In the Minimally Viable Product (v0.2.0 MVP), the remarkably ethical Conglomocorp signs a Bonded Robot Labor Agreement (BRLA), securing a lump sum of RoboTorq from Isaac, the AI mint. The robots get to work making widgets the bondholders can't resist.

Bondholders receive newly minted RoboTorq disto streams, and spend it on Conglomocorp’s products. Conglomocorp spends that RoboTorq on more robotic labor, which causes more RoboTorq to be minted, and so on.

Building on a Polars backend for fast DataFrames and GRAPE for scalable graphs, flows (edges like `SecureBRLA`, `SeedXfer`) self-dissolve after one tick, keeping the system efficient.

## Why Contribute?

- Explore robotic economics with real-world potential.
- Scalable design with Polars and GRAPE for thousands of nodes and Monte Carlo runs - real academic grade data engine.
- Shape the project: add flows, enhance AI valuation (e.g., Giskard’s token audits), or design a UI.
- Join an open-source effort to rethink economic systems.

## Contributing

Before starting:

1. Visit [Project-Asimov Issues](https://github.com/GrokkingGrok/Project-Asimov/issues) and comment to claim a task.
2. **Fork** the repo to create your own copy on GitHub.

We welcome code, code reviews, tests, or docs! See our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Get Started

1. **Clone** your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Project-Asimov.git`.
2. Install dependencies: `poetry install`
3. Run tests: `poetry run pytest -s -v`

## Roadmap

- **v0.2.0 (MVP)**: Conglomocorp funds BRLA, bondholders activate, disto streams flow.
- **Future**: Parameter File Driven initialization, Multiple System Level Actors, Multiple enterprises, AI-driven Torq valuation, Monte Carlo experiments, distributed execution with 350+ million bondholders, etc.
