# Project Asimov: Robotic Economics (Robonomics) Simulation
What if robots don't just produce things? What if every time a robot makes something, an AI crypto-mint spins up and you get a tiny bit of that value in your digital wallet as a new cryptocurrency, RoboTorq?

What if you just found the repo simulating such an economy?

## What are we working on now?
With two prototypes of mistakes out of the way, we're defining the entire Minimally Viable Product (MVP) in English as we adapt to the new system architecture.

# Why Contribute?
What economic system enables a Kardashev Type 1 civilization? Do you really think it's what we've got now?

What happens when AI and robots swallow jobs wholesale? Print money for UBI and hope you don't need a wheelbarrow full of cash to buy a loaf of bread next year?

What if we can turn job replacement into an economic system's strength, even its primary growth factor, rather than a death sentence?

Does anyone saying "The future is abundance" with starry-eyed fever pitch have any clue what that actually means, or is it baseless hype?

Project Asimov isn't selling dreams: it's old-fashioned hard work today applied to the problems of tomorrow.

Maybe Robonomics is a terrible idea. Maybe it's Kardashev 1+ economics. Project Asimov is the place for people who want to make tangible progress toward making that call.

If you so choose, this is where your contribution begins.

## Specific Needs
While anyone interested is encouraged to engage in any capacity they feel comfortable with, we do have specific needs in some key areas that could significantly accelerate the project. Another way to look at this list is that it is the kind of stuff you'll have the opportunity to learn if you want to help.

**Developer Skillsets**
  - Python
  - Polars library
  - QuantEcon library
  - GRAPE graph management
  - Dask distributed computing
  - Ray AI/cluster integration
  - UI/UX

**Other Needs**
  - Project Managers who enjoy overseeing a feature from planning through production
  - Economists for consulting on model execution (help us model it, write a paper about the results and publish it)
  - PR people to create and spread press releases
  - Social media management
  - Lawyers with experience in cryptocurrency, finance, or open-source transition to enterprise if that ever becomes an issue

If you think you're a good fit for a non-technical role, post a comment on the discussion board, [send Jon a DM on X](https://x.com/ProjectAsimov), or claim an issue on the issue board if you already have clarity on your path.

## Getting Started for Technical Roles
For now, familiarize yourself with [Asimov's system architecture](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Coding won't begin until the entire MVP's *flow* logic has been defined in English, naming conventions have been fully defined, and every MVP `actor's` schema attributes are known.

Jon is hard at work defining new *flow* loop logics.

We welcome all good-faith contributions in accordance with our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). (TL;DR, don't be a dou*&^ make sure every feature has a unit test)

## Roadmap
We're starting small.
- **v0.3.0 (MVP)**: Conglomocorp funds BRLA, Robots work, Isaac mints, disto streams flow, bondholders spend, Conglomocorp pays more robots, Isaac mints more money, etc etc etc...
- **Future**: Parameter File Driven initialization, UI, Live Parameter Updates via UI, Multiple System Level Actors, Multiple enterprises, AI-driven Torq valuation, Monte Carlo experiments, distributed execution with thousands+ bondholders, etc.
