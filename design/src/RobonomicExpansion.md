# Robonomic Expansion

RoboTorq economies expand and contract in direct proportion to the value of the robotic labor occurring at any given time, because that determines how much RoboTorq is minted. Simple enough.

But facilitating that growth may not be so straight forward. Obviously, it requires more Robots: but only if the ones you have are working at capacity and demand is not met. 

But more robots are not always going to cut it. For starters,  Daneels's fleet needs to maintain a reserve of robots to smooth out spikes in utilzation. So purchases need to be planned in advance.

Robots need TokenTorq from Giskard in order to mine Torq while producing. If Giskard is short on TokenTorq Capacity, data centers need to upgraded, which means a new Deep Underground Military Bunker. 

But that's not all. Isaac needs minting backup capacity upgrades. That means sending Starship Data Centers to orbit.

And it takes time to get Robots, data center bunkers, and Starships funded, built, and deployed.

And Calvin? She needs Starlink upgrades.  Of that's right, we haven't talked about Calvin yet. 

Calvin is named after Susan Calvin, the human psychologist for robots from Asimov's work. Here, Calvin is the human representative mechanism of the bond network. And humans vote with their RoboTorq on things like economic expansion efforts.

The bond network is engineered so that no one person or AI has the power to expand unilaterally. 

Likewise, no actor can hold back expansion arbitrarily. But, how is this achieved?
