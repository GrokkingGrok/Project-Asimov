## 1. What Is Torq?

**Torq** is the *physical unit of markup* in Robonomic Lingo — and the physical anchor of value in AI-driven production systems.  

It links **information processing**, **energy expenditure**, and **economic output**.

---

## 2. Deriving the RoboTorq

Imagine a thermodynamically perfect **1 kW humanoid robot**.  
It doesn’t exist (and never will), but assume you have one.

**What is the physical value of that robot’s ideal task for one hour?**


$1\ \text{RoboTorq} / 1\ \text{RoboHour} = 1\ \text{token} \times 1\ \text{kW}$


Because one ideal 1 kW robot working for one hour processes one token with 1 J/s of energy for 3600 s.

Hence:

$$
1\ \text{RoboTorq} = 1\ \text{token} \times 1\ \text{kW} \times 1\ \text{RoboHour}
$$

And:

$$
1\ \text{kW} \times 1\ \text{RoboHour} = 3.6 \times 10^6\ \text{RoboJoules}
$$

---

### 2.1 The Novel Units

| Symbol | Definition | Meaning |
|:-------|:------------|:--------|
| **RoboTorq** | token × kWh | Base physical unit of robotic labor value |
| **TokenTorq** | token × RoboJoule | Energy-information coupling at micro scale |
| **RoboJoule** | Joule (contextualized) | Energy used by robotic labor |
| **TTP** | TokenTorq / hour | Robot’s capacity to process tokens |

---

### 2.2 Relationship Between Units

$$
1\ \text{RoboTorq} = 1\ \text{token} \times 3.6 \times 10^6\ \text{RoboJoules}
$$

or equivalently:

$$
1\ \text{RoboTorq} = 3.6\ \text{TokenTorq} = 3.6\ (\text{token} \times \text{kWh})
$$

and

$$
1\ \text{TokenTorq} = \frac{1}{3.6}\ \text{RoboTorq} = 0.277778\ \text{RoboTorq}
$$

Thus, **1 RoboTorq** represents the value produced by an ideal 1 kW robot processing one token with 1 J/s of energy for one hour.

---

## 3. Physical Backing and Stability

Unlike the **gold standard**, the **RoboTorq** is not commodity-backed.  
It is **physically defined**, rooted in thermodynamics and tied directly to robotic labor.

Subjective market value may change, but its *physical definition cannot*.  
It is the first **physics-anchored unit of economic value**.

---

## 4. The TorqMining Loop

The **Torq Mining Flow Loop** is where production happens and value is created.  
It unites:

- AI energy consumption  
- Token throughput (capacity)  
- Robotic utilization  
- Minting of RoboTorq  

This forms the **mathematical bridge** between AI token flow and minted value — the essence of **Torq Theory**.

---

## 5. Core Definitions

### TokenTorqPotential (TTP)

A robot’s **TokenTorqPotential** is its rated throughput (TokenTorq per hour).  
Example: “This is a 2 TTP bot.”

- Sold at **3.6 TokenTorq / RoboTorq / hour**
- Defines how energized tokens translate into physical value

If \( TTP = 2 \), then the robot consumes 2 TokenTorq per hour and costs \( 2 / 3.6 \) RoboTorq / hr.

---

## 6. The Equation of AI-Value Exchange

At equilibrium:

$$
\frac{RoboTorq_{out}}{RoboTorq_{in}} = \frac{TokenTorq_{out}}{TokenTorq_{in}}
$$

Therefore:

$$
RoboTorq_{out} = \frac{TokenTorq_{out}}{TokenTorq_{in}} \times RoboTorq_{in}
$$

Let \( Torq = \frac{TokenTorq_{out}}{TokenTorq_{in}} \), then:

$$
RoboTorq_{out} = Torq \times RoboTorq_{in}
$$

---

### 6.1 Dimensional Consistency Check

| Quantity | Units |
|-----------|--------|
| RoboTorq | token × kWh |
| Torq | dimensionless |
| Equation | ✅ dimensionally valid |

---

### 6.2 Macro-Economic Analogy

This mirrors **MV = PQ** from classical fiat systems.

- In Robonomics, **TokenTorqIn** represents society’s *investment rate* in robotic labor.  
- No central bank is required — circulation self-balances through **demurrage**.  
- Idle RoboTorq is swept into **TorqVaults**, prompting reinvestment.

---

## 7. The Torq_Gamble: Markup as Wager

The **torq_gamble** is the Enterprise’s *bet* on how much Torq will be generated (markup).

$$
Minting_{needed} = RoboTorq_{in} \times (torq_{gamble} - 1)
$$

or equivalently:

$$
Minting_{needed} = \frac{1}{3.6} \times Robot.TTP \times (torq_{gamble} - 1)
$$

Both **Enterprise** and **Isaac (the Minting AI)** co-wager on productivity.

---

## 8. Complexity and AIntropy

No robot is perfect; production efficiency depends on **complexity** and **AIntropy**.

### Complexity
- \( complexity \neq 0 \)
- Negative → diminishing returns (single-item tasks)
- Positive → compounding returns (multi-item Oracles)

### AIntropy

$$
AIntropy = complexity \times TTP \times Robot_{util} \times supply_{efficiency} \times equipment_{utilization} \times ...
$$

Lower AIntropy → slower learning, lower token efficiency.  
Higher AIntropy → faster convergence, higher Torq output.

---

## 9. The TokenTorq Curve

A sigmoid function models robotic learning efficiency:

$$
token\_torq\_curve(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-t \times AIntropy}} \times torq_{gamble}
$$

where \( 0 < token\_torq\_curve < 1 \).

It describes how efficiently the robot transforms AI tokens into productive output over time.

---

## 10. Mining TokenTorq into Torq

Integrate the TokenTorq curve to yield the **Torq Mining Curve**:

$$
torq\_mining\_curve(t) = \int token\_torq\_curve(t)\ dt
$$

At full utilization:

$$
torq\_mining\_curve = \ln(AIntropy(1 + e^{t \times AIntropy})) - t \times AIntropy
$$

When production ends, total Torq is submitted to **Isaac** as a *MintRequest* for RoboTorq issuance.

---

## 11. Sample Calculation

Given:

| Variable | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| \( TTP \) | 5 |
| \( torq_{gamble} \) | 3 |
| \( AIntropy \) | 0.5 × TTP = 2.5 |
| Duration | 100 ticks |

Then:

$$
RoboTorq_{in} = \frac{5}{3.6} = 1.389\ \text{per tick}
$$

$$
Minting_{needed} = 1.389 \times 100 \times (3 - 1) = 277.778\ \text{RoboTorq}
$$

Total projected sale value:

$$
138.889 + 277.778 = 416.667\ \text{RoboTorq}
$$

Isaac mints 277.778 RoboTorq (profit/markup) and redistributes it to bondholders.  
Operating costs recycle through the Bond Network — maintaining **monetary equilibrium**.

---

## 12. Incentives and Strategy

Could Enterprises game the system by mis-bidding torq_gamble?  

- **Under-bidding:** not enough RoboTorq in circulation → liquidity shortage.  
- **Over-bidding:** detected by BidNet → stiffer BRLA terms, higher future costs.

Chronic manipulators are downgraded to **TorqVault financing**, where credit is expensive.  

Thus, Enterprises compete *against* and *cooperate with* AI financial overseers —  
a self-optimizing market through **algorithmic game equilibrium**.

---

## 13. Quantum Game-Theoretic Interpretation

The **torq_gamble** *entangles* Enterprise and BidNet in a shared probabilistic state.  
Until sale, both exist in a **superposition** of profit and loss — a qubit-like duality.

When the product sells, the wave collapses — the market “measures” value.

This allows **BidNet** to leverage **quantum-inspired game theory**, querying historical BRLA outcomes through **Calvin**, the predictive AI forecaster.

---

## 14. Closing Thoughts

**RoboTorq** formalizes the relationship between **information**, **energy**, and **value**.  

It converts the abstract “cost of compute” into a **physically defined monetary unit**, where each minted token is tied to measurable work.

Rooted in physics, expanded by AI, and governed by clear equations —  
**Torq Theory** transforms economics into an exact science of energy-value exchange.
