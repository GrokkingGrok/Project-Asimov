## Abstract

As the innovation of Robotic Labor and the job replacement it threatens sit quietly on the horizon, it's hard to know whether to be excited or concerned. The potential problem is clear, but the solution is not.

Standard Universal Basic Income schemes, managed by politicians and financed by bankers, have no value basis. What happens if the "basic" amount puts the money supply out of balance? Rampant inflation or deflation.

Traditional Universal Basic Dividend schemes often [return a relatively small portion](https://ffesp.org/1702-pfd-stimulus-check/#:~:text=Alaska%20residents%20received%20a%20$1%2C702,dropped%20to%20$1%2C000%20for%202025.) because they are garnered from just one industry or sector.

Robonomics proposes a private, yet collectively owned Bond Network that entitles every citizen to a share of the proceeds from the labor of every humanoid robot working in every sector. Under such a system, every job lost to robots becomes a boon to society, and private individual ownership of humanoid robots becomes tantamount to counterfeiting.

Robonomics represents a paradigm shift in economic theory — and, if we choose to make it real, in human history.

## 1. What Is Torq?

Torq is the physical unit of markup in Robonomic Lingo — and the scalar of value creation in AI-driven production systems.

It links **information processing**, **energy expenditure**, and **economic output**.

Torq Theory is the mathematical method for deriving the value of the energized AI token throughput used by a robot while performing labor.

---

## 2. Deriving the RoboTorq

I propose a new currency to value robotic labor: The RoboTorq.

The RoboTorq is expressed in organically derived units and is defined as the amount of work done by an ideal robot performing its ideal task in one hour.

Imagine a thermodynamically perfect 1 kW humanoid robot.  
It doesn’t exist (and never will), but assume you have one.

What is the physical value of that robot’s ideal task for one hour?

1 RoboTorq / 1 RoboHour = 1 token × 1 kW

Why? One ideal 1 kW robot processing one token with one joule/second of energy for 3600 seconds.

A token is a small, contextual piece of digital information that can be processed by a robot's or an AI's neural network.

Hence:

1 RoboTorq = 1 token × 1 kW × 1 RoboHour

And:

1 kW × 1 RoboHour = 3.6 × 10⁶ RoboJoules

---

### 2.1 The Novel Units

| Symbol     | Definition            | Meaning                                  |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| RoboTorq   | token × kWh            | Base physical unit of robotic labor value |
| TokenTorq  | token × RoboJoule      | Energy-information coupling at micro scale |
| RoboJoule  | Joule (contextualized) | Energy used by robotic labor             |
| TokenTorqPotential        | TokenTorq/hour         | Robot’s capacity to process tokens       |

A RoboJoule is to a Joule as a Newton Meter (a measure of physical torque) is to a Joule. It is a contextual framing of the same units for a specific use case.

---

### 2.2 Relationship Between Units

1 RoboTorq = 1 token × 3.6 × 10⁶ RoboJoules 
1 RoboTorq = 3.6 TokenTorq = 3.6 (token × kWh) = 3.6 (token·kg·m²)/(s²·h)
Hence 1 TokenTorq = 1/3.6 RoboTorq ≈ 0.277778 RoboTorq

Thus, one RoboTorq means the value created by an ideal 1 kW robot processing one token with one joule/second of energy for an hour.

In practice, no bot will achieve this ideal — and that’s fine. We still measure temperature in Kelvin even though absolute zero is impossible, and the same goes for Carnot Efficiency.

---

## 3. Physical Backing and Stability

Unlike the gold standard, the RoboTorq is not strictly commodity-backed. Yet it can still be treated similarly.  
It is **physically defined**, rooted in thermodynamics, and tied directly to robotic labor.

The subjective market value that humans place on it may change with time, but the *physical definition* of the RoboTorq may not.  
The RoboTorq is the first **physics-based unit of economic value**.

---

## 4. The TorqMining Loop

The Torq Mining Loop is where production happens and value is created.  
It unites:

- AI energy consumption  
- Token throughput (capacity)  
- Robotic utilization  
- Minting of RoboTorq  

This forms the mathematical bridge between AI token flow and minted value — the essence of Torq Theory.

---

## 5. Core Definitions

### TokenTorqPotential (TTP)

A robot’s “TokenTorqPotential” is its rated TokenTorq throughput per hour.  
Example: “This is a 2 TTP bot.”

- Sold at 3.6 TokenTorq / RoboTorq / hour, everywhere and always.
- Defines the exchange basis for energized tokens transforming into physical value  
- TokenTorq (throughput) over time — 1 RoboTorq buys 3.6 TokenTorq of processing; different robots have different hourly throughputs (processing power).
- I pay for the bot's maximum throughput capacity, regardless of how much I can use productively.

Example: If I hire a 10 TTP bot for 10 hours, I will pay 36 RT — even if I only get 2 TokenTorq (7.2 RT) of base value out. As the robot learns the task, I'll get better returns.

And this brings us to the mathematical definitions of Torq.

Three definitions of Torq:
- Torq = TokenTorq_out / TokenTorq_in  
- Torq = RoboTorq_out / RoboTorq_in  
- Torq = Tokens_out / Tokens_in

---

## 6. The Equation of AI-Value Exchange

Because Torq can be found from using three different ratios, we can draw some interesting conclusions.

| Symbol     | Definition            | Meaning                                  |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| equilibrium  | RoboTorq_out / RoboTorq_in = TokenTorq_out / TokenTorq_in   | Functions similarly to MV = PQ |
| Therefore  | RoboTorq_out = (TokenTorq_out / TokenTorq_in) × RoboTorq_in   | = Oracle.cost + newly_minted |
| Let  | Torq = TokenTorq_out / TokenTorq_in | = RoboTorq_out / RoboTorq_in   |
| Conclude  | RoboTorq_out = Torq × RoboTorq_in| = reduced form AI-Value Exchange   |

---

### 6.1 Dimensional Consistency Check

| Quantity   | Units               |
|------------|---------------------|
| RoboTorq_in   | token × kWh         |
| Torq       | dimensionless       |
| RoboTorq_out   | token × kWh |

---

### 6.2 Relation to Current Macro-Economic Theory

This equation mirrors the classical [MV = PQ](https://public.econ.duke.edu/~kdh9/Courses/Graduate%20Macro%20History/Readings-1/Fisher%20Purchasing%20Power%20of%20Money.pdf) identity from fiat economics.

In Robonomics:
- TokenTorq_in is the rate at which society invests in robotic labor.  
- No central bank is required — circulation is maintained via production/minting cycles.  
- If idle RoboTorq accumulates, [**demurrage** sweeps value into **TorqVaults**, prompting reinvestment.](https://github.com/GrokkingGrok/Project-Asimov/blob/MVP/CONTRIBUTING.md#systemic-actors-and-their-interactions-in-detail-ideal-simulation-behavior)

---

## 7. The Torq_Gamble: Markup as Wager

The “torq_gamble” is the Enterprise’s wager on how much Torq will be generated — effectively their markup expectation.

MintingNeeded = RoboTorq_in × (torq_gamble − 1)  
Alternatively:  
MintingNeeded = 3.6 × Robot.TTP × (torq_gamble − 1)

Both the Enterprise and Isaac (the minting AI) [co-wager on productivity.](https://github.com/GrokkingGrok/Project-Asimov/blob/MVP/design/src/RobonomicExpansion.md#skins-in-the-game)

The “torq_gamble” is agreed upon by both the Enterprise and BidNet (the AI robotic labor auctionhouse) at the time of paying the retainer fee for a Bonded Robotic Labor Agreement (BRLA).

---

## 8. Complexity and AIntropy

Real robots are imperfect; production efficiency varies with task complexity and AI/robot interaction.

### Complexity  
- Non-zero scalar governing convergence and productivity over time.  
- Negative complexity → diminishing Torq gains (single-item tasks).  
- Positive complexity → compounding Torq gains (multi-item Oracles).

### AIntropy (Artificial Intropy)  
AIntropy = complexity × TTP × Robot.util × supply_efficiency × equipment_utilization × …

- Lower AIntropy → slower learning, lower token efficiency.  
- Higher AIntropy → faster convergence, higher Torq output.

This models how inefficiencies push operations away from the thermodynamic ideal and require more RoboTorq per unit value created.

---

## 9. The TokenTorq Curve

The token_torq_curve models robotic learning efficiency over time:

token_torq_curve(t) = 1 / (1 + e^(−t × AIntropy)) × torq_gamble

where 0 < token_torq_curve(t) < 1.

Describes how efficiently a robot transforms AI-tokens into productive output over time.

This function is a [standard Sigmoid Neural Net Activation time-function.](https://hal.science/hal-02635089v1/file/Sigmoid_Function_HAL.pdf)

---

## 10. Mining TokenTorq into Torq

Integrating the token_torq_curve yields the Torq Mining Curve, expressing cumulative value generation:

torq_mining_curve(t) = ∫ token_torq_curve(t) dt

At full utilization:

torq_mining_curve ≈ ln( AIntropy × (1 + e^(t × AIntropy)))

When production ends, the total Torq is submitted to Isaac as a MintRequest for RoboTorq issuance.

Thankfully, we don't need all this math to run through a simple example. We can use the Equation of AI-Value Exchange to do that!

---

## 11. Sample Calculation

Let's say I want to mass-produce some items. I can afford 100 hours of robotic labor, and I've got a BRLA. So I spin up my line of bots, and they work for 100 ticks (100 sim-hours) of the Asimov robonomics simulator.

Given:
- TTP = 5 TokenTorq/hr
- Duration = 100 hrs
- torq_gamble = 3

1. Thermodynamic Input Value (RoboTorq_in):
   = TTP × 3.6 × 100
   = 5 × 3.6 × 100 = 1,800 RT

2. MintingNeeded:
   = 1,800 × (3 − 1) = 3,600 RT

3. Total Value Out:
   = 1,800 + 3,600 = 5,400 RT

4. Items: 400 → Sell at 13.5 RT each

The robots managed to produce 400 items for me, and I can sell them for 13.5 RT per to make the profit my business needs to stay alive.

Isaac mints 3600 fresh RoboTorq (value-added to a pile of raw materials, scaled from the cost of the robotic labor that added the value) and distributes it to bondholders in bits as the product is expected to hit the market, who will engage in spending, investing, or saving, allowing the newly minted currency to accumulate for purchase.

Operating costs recycle into circulation — the money supply remains balanced.

A few notes on why minting is not (RoboTorq_in + other production costs) (torq - 1):
- With relatively few humans involved, most of the production costs are paid to other Enterprises for raw materials.
- If they are also relying on robotic labor to a large degree, very little of their revenue will be going to Bondholders (citizens own a portion of every robot via RoboBonds).
- If the Enterprise plans to sell the item to Bondholders, the money is already available, and economic activity (competition) is required to move it.
- If the Enterprise plans to build a large commercial asset, the buyer is likely already arranging financing through a BuyerFunnel the Bond Network's investment house, The RoboFund Exchange.

---

## 12. Incentives and Strategy

Could Enterprises game the system by mis-bidding the torq_gamble or manipulating timelines? Yes. But the system is self-correcting:

- **Under-bidding** → not enough RoboTorq in circulation → liquidity dries up → business left with extra stock and losses.  
- **Over-bidding** → visible in BidNet’s market analytics → future BRLA terms tighten → go back to human labor or agree to stricter terms.

Persistent manipulators are downgraded to **TorqVault financing**, which is more expensive.
Thus, Enterprises compete *against* and *cooperate with* AI financial overseers — producing a self-optimizing economy.

---

## 13. Quantum Game-Theoretic Interpretation

Each torq_gamble *entangles* the Enterprise and BidNet in a shared probabilistic state.  
Until a sale occurs, both exist in a **superposition** of profit and loss — much like a qubit before measurement.

When a product sells, the wave function collapses — the market “observes” value.

BidNet can employ quantum-inspired game theory, using its predictive AI (Calvin) to forecast outcomes from past BRLAs. This is a literal quantum-influenced market dynamic.

---

## 14. Closing Thoughts

RoboTorq is not an abstraction — it’s a measurable bridge between *information*, *energy*, and *value*.  

Robonomics is not just a fanciful idea — it could be our practical fiat escape hatch, serving as a reserve of excess paper currency as RoboTorq seeds are exchanged to purchase robotic labor, propping up the value of the dollar as the currency switch is made.

Torq Theory formalizes the economic cost of compute and robotic labor into a **physically anchored monetary unit**, where each minted token is tied to real productive work. But this happens without the currency shortages associated with old hard currencies or the inherent inflationary tendencies of fiat currency.

Rooted in physics, expanded by AI, governed by sharp equations — **Torq Theory** turns Robonomics into an exact science of energy-value exchange.
