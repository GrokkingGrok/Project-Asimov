## 1. What Is Torq?

Torq is the physical unit of markup in Robonomic Lingo — and the scalar of value creation in AI-driven production systems.

It links **information processing**, **energy expenditure**, and **economic output**.

The RoboTorq is a unit of currency derived from the physical units of energized AI token throughput.

## 2. Deriving the RoboTorq

Imagine a thermodynamically perfect 1 kW humanoid robot.  
It doesn’t exist (and never will), but assume you have one.

What is the physical value of that robot’s ideal task for one hour?

1 RoboTorq / 1 RoboHour = 1 token × 1 kW

Why? One ideal 1 kW robot processing one token with one joule/second of energy for 3600 seconds.

A token is a small, usable piece of digital information that can be processed by a robot or an AI's neural network.

Hence:

1 RoboTorq = 1 token × 1 kW × 1 RoboHour

And:

1 kW × 1 RoboHour = 3.6 × 10⁶ RoboJoules

### 2.1 The Novel Units

| Symbol     | Definition            | Meaning                                  |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| RoboTorq   | token × kWh            | Base physical unit of robotic labor value |
| TokenTorq  | token × RoboJoule      | Energy-information coupling at micro scale |
| RoboJoule  | Joule (contextualized) | Energy used by robotic labor             |
| TokenTorqPotential        | TokenTorq/hour         | Robot’s capacity to process tokens       |

A RoboJoule is to a Joule as a Newton Meter (a measure of physical torque) is to a Joule. It is a contextual framing of the same units for a specific use case.

---

### 2.2 Relationship Between Units

1 RoboTorq = 1 token × 3.6 × 10⁶ RoboJoules  
1 RoboTorq = 3.6 TokenTorq = 3.6 (token × kWh)  
Hence 1 TokenTorq = 1/3.6 RoboTorq ≈ 0.277778 RoboTorq

Thus, one RoboTorq means the value created by an ideal 1 kW robot processing one token with one joule/second of energy for an hour.

In practice, no bot will achieve this ideal — and that’s fine. We still measure temperature in Kelvin even though absolute zero is impossible, and the same goes for Carnot Efficiency.

---

## 3. Physical Backing and Stability

Unlike the gold standard, the RoboTorq is not stictly commodity-backed. Yet it can still be treated similarly.  
It is **physically defined**, rooted in thermodynamics, and tied directly to robotic labor.

Subjective market value that humans place on it may change with time, but the *physical definition* of the RoboTorq may not.  
The RoboTorq is the first **physics-based unit of economic value**.

---

## 4. The TorqMining Loop

The Torq Mining Loop is where production happens and value is created.  
It unites:

- AI energy consumption  
- Token throughput (capacity)  
- Robotic utilization  
- Minting of RoboTorq  

This forms the mathematical bridge between AI token flow and minted value — the essence of Torq Theory.

---

## 5. Core Definitions

### TokenTorqPotential (TTP)

A robot’s “TokenTorqPotential” is its rated throughput in TokenTorq per hour.  
Example: “This is a 2 TTP bot.”

- Sold at 3.6 TokenTorq / RoboTorq / hour  
- Defines the exchange basis for energized tokens transforming into physical value  
- Throughput-based, not time-based — 1 RoboTorq buys 3.6 TokenTorq of processing, whether used in an hour or a year

Definitions of Torq:
- Torq = TokenTorq_out / TokenTorq_in  
- Torq = RoboTorq_out / RoboTorq_in  
- Torq = Tokens_out / Tokens_in

---

## 6. The Equation of AI-Value Exchange

| Symbol     | Definition            | Meaning                                  |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| equilibrium  | RoboTorq_out / RoboTorq_in = TokenTorq_out / TokenTorq_in   | Functions similarly to MV = PQ |
| Therefore  | RoboTorq_out = (TokenTorq_out / TokenTorq_in) × RoboTorq_in   | = Oracle.cost + newly_minted |
| Let  | Torq = TokenTorq_out / TokenTorq_in | = RoboTorq_out / RoboTorq_in   |
| Conclude  | RoboTorq_out = Torq × RoboTorq_in| = reduced form AI-Value Exchange   |

---

### 6.1 Dimensional Consistency Check

| Quantity   | Units               |
|------------|---------------------|
| RoboTorq_in   | token × kWh         |
| Torq       | dimensionless       |
| RoboTorq_out   | token × kWh |

---

### 6.2 Relation to Current Macro-Economic Theory

This equation mirrors the classical [MV = PQ](https://public.econ.duke.edu/~kdh9/Courses/Graduate%20Macro%20History/Readings-1/Fisher%20Purchasing%20Power%20of%20Money.pdf) identity from fiat economics.

In Robonomics:
- TokenTorq_in is the rate at which society invests in robotic labor.  
- No central bank is required — circulation is maintained via production cycles.  
- If idle RoboTorq accumulates, [**demurrage** sweeps value into **TorqVaults**, prompting reinvestment.](https://github.com/GrokkingGrok/Project-Asimov/blob/MVP/CONTRIBUTING.md#systemic-actors-and-their-interactions-in-detail-ideal-simulation-behavior)

---

## 7. The Torq_Gamble: Markup as Wager

The “torq_gamble” is the Enterprise’s wager on how much Torq will be generated — effectively their markup expectation.

MintingNeeded = RoboTorq_in × (torq_gamble − 1)  
Alternatively:  
MintingNeeded = (1/3.6) × Robot.TTP × (torq_gamble − 1)

Both the Enterprise and Isaac (the minting AI) [co-wager on productivity.](https://github.com/GrokkingGrok/Project-Asimov/blob/MVP/design/src/RobonomicExpansion.md#skins-in-the-game)

The “torq_gamble” is agreed upon by both the Enterprise and BidNet (the AI robotic labor auctionhouse), at the time of paying the retainer fee from a Bonded Robotic Labor Agreement (BRLA).

---

## 8. Complexity and AIntropy

Real robots are imperfect; production efficiency varies with task complexity and AI/robot interaction.

### Complexity  
- Non-zero scalar governing convergence and productivity over time.  
- Negative complexity → diminishing Torq gains (single-item tasks).  
- Positive complexity → compounding Torq gains (multi-item Oracles).

### AIntropy (Artificial Intropy)  
AIntropy = complexity × TTP × Robot.util × supply_efficiency × equipment_utilization × …

- Lower AIntropy → slower learning, lower token efficiency.  
- Higher AIntropy → faster convergence, higher Torq output.

This models how inefficiencies push operations away from the thermodynamic ideal and require more RoboTorq per unit value created.

---

## 9. The TokenTorq Curve

The token_torq_curve models robotic learning efficiency over time:

token_torq_curve(t) = 1 / (1 + e^(−t × AIntropy)) × torq_gamble

where 0 < token_torq_curve(t) < 1.

Describes how efficiently a robot transforms AI-tokens into productive output over time.

This function is a [standard Sigmoid Neural Net Activation time-function.](https://hal.science/hal-02635089v1/file/Sigmoid_Function_HAL.pdf)

---

## 10. Mining TokenTorq into Torq

Integrating the token_torq_curve yields the Torq Mining Curve, expressing cumulative value generation:

torq_mining_curve(t) = ∫ token_torq_curve(t) dt

At full utilization:

torq_mining_curve ≈ ln( AIntropy × (1 + e^(t × AIntropy)))

When production ends, the total Torq is submitted to Isaac as a MintRequest for RoboTorq issuance.

---

## 11. Sample Calculation

Given:  
- TTP = 5  
- torq_gamble = 3  
- AIntropy = 0.5 × TTP = 2.5  
- Duration = 100 ticks

Then:  
RoboTorq_in = 5 / 3.6 ≈ 1.389 per tick  
MintingNeeded = 1.389 × 100 × (3 − 1) = 277.778 RoboTorq  

Total projected sale value = 138.889 + 277.778 = 416.667 RoboTorq  

Isaac mints 277.778 RoboTorq (profit/markup) and redistributes to bondholders.  
Operating costs recycle into circulation — the money supply remains balanced.

---

## 12. Incentives and Strategy

Could Enterprises game the system by mis-bidding the torq_gamble or manipulating timelines? Yes. But the system is self-correcting:

- **Under-bidding** → not enough RoboTorq in circulation → liquidity dries up.  
- **Over-bidding** → visible in BidNet’s analytics → future BRLA terms tighten.

Persistent manipulators are downgraded to **TorqVault financing**, which is more expensive.  
Thus, Enterprises compete *against* and *cooperate with* AI financial overseers — producing a self-optimizing economy.

---

## 13. Quantum Game-Theoretic Interpretation

Each torq_gamble *entangles* the Enterprise and BidNet in a shared probabilistic state.  
Until a sale occurs, both exist in a **superposition** of profit and loss — much like a qubit before measurement.

When a product sells, the wave function collapses — the market “observes” value.

BidNet can employ quantum-inspired game theory, using its predictive AI (Calvin) to forecast outcomes from past BRLAs. This is a literal quantum-influenced market dynamic.

---

## 14. Closing Thoughts

RoboTorq is not an abstraction — it’s a measurable bridge between *information*, *energy*, and *value*.  

It formalizes the economic cost of compute and robotic labor into a **physically defined monetary unit**, where each minted token is tied to real productive work.

Rooted in physics, expanded by AI, governed by sharp equations —  
**Torq Theory** turns economics into an exact science of energy-value exchange.
